That is a fantastic request! Combining a Python/Django backend for heavy lifting (like data processing and visualization with Matplotlib) with a dynamic React frontend is a standard, robust architecture.

Since this is a distributed application, I will generate two files for you:

1.  **`plot_api_view.py`**: A Python file simulating the Django REST framework view. This view contains the mathematical function and uses Matplotlib to generate a sine wave plot, returning the image data as a Base64 string.
2.  **`PlotApp.jsx`**: A single-file React application that provides an input field, calls the simulated Python API (using a mock response for demonstration), and renders the image data dynamically.

Please note that for the `PlotApp.jsx` to be runnable in this environment, the `fetch` call is mocked to immediately return a sample Base64 image, as the actual Python/Django server is not running.

Here are the files:

## 1. Python/Django Backend (Simulation)

This file shows the core logic for the Django view that handles the request, computes the data, plots it using Matplotlib, and converts it to a Base64-encoded PNG image for transmission over the API.

## 2. React Frontend

This single-file React application handles the user input and the rendering of the plot image received from the backend. Since the Django API is not running, the `fetch` call is mocked to demonstrate the functionality.

The React component, `PlotApp.jsx`, demonstrates the client-side logic: capturing user input, making an API request, and rendering the Base64 image data as a dynamic source URL (`data:image/png;base64,...`).

The Python file, `plot_api_view.py`, contains the server-side logic: taking the amplitude, generating the data, creating the Matplotlib plot, and encoding it for transport.

To run this complete application, you would need to:
1.  Set up a Django project.
2.  Configure a URL to map to the `sine_plot_api_view` function.
3.  Run the Django server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver`).
4.  Serve the React application, which would then make AJAX calls to the running Django server.
